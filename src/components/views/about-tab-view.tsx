                I&apos;m a full-stack software engineer with 4.5 years of
                professional experience, but I started coding before high
                school.

                I started programming when I was just 13. I learned how to code in
                Java and then created my own Minecraft server, which was very
                successful and quickly grew to a network of 4 different servers.

                In High School, I became more interested in mobile development
                using Java and Kotlin. I developed an Android app to show
                real-time information about what was happening on my servers.
                The players could access the server chat, manage their friend
                groups, and check the live prices of all the stores on the 4
                different servers - just like a &quot;mini stock market&quot;
            </p>

                Fast-forward to today, I&apos;ve had the privilege of working at 
                three different companies. My main focus these days is 
                building intuitive products and digital experiences at Fauri 
                Risk Solutions for a variety of clients.
